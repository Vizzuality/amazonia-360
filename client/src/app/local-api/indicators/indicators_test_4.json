Species counts were aggregated into an H3 level 6 grid (approximately 30 km² cells). Sampling was conducted using centroids separated by 7 km, and species richness ranges were interpolated. The resulting fields include:  \n- **SPRange**: Defines the numerical range of species richness in each polygon (e.g., '<250 species', '800–1,000 species'), offering a quantitative biodiversity framework.  \n- **SPClass1**: Describes the ecological and environmental characteristics associated with each richness range, detailing the ecosystem context and importance (e.g., 'extremely low species richness' or 'very high species richness').  \n\n**Key Applications**  \nThis layer is a valuable tool for scientists, planners, and environmental managers, supporting sustainable development and biodiversity conservation efforts. It helps prioritize conservation actions, monitor trends, and analyze the impact of human activities on ecosystems.  \n\n**Data Access**  \n- Available to registered users on IBAT: https://www.ibat-alliance.org/  \n- Publicly accessible spatial data from the IUCN Red List:  \n  https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/spatial-data-download?utm_source=chatgpt.com  \n\n**Methodology and Mapping Standards**  \nFor detailed mapping standards and criteria, refer to *Mapping_Standards_Version_1.20_Jan2024.pdf*:  \nhttps://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/mappingstandards  ",

The description for each class includes both qualitative and quantitative values. This dataset is useful for identifying spatial precipitation patterns in the Amazon, assessing their relationship with ecosystems, vegetation, and biodiversity, and establishing a framework for **water resource management, climate adaptation, and territorial planning**.\n\nThis dataset was compiled by **AmazoniaForever360+ (2023)** based on a reclassification of the original climatic data from **WorldClim**, specifically the **BIO12 bioclimatic variable**, which represents total annual precipitation. This variable is part of WorldClim's widely used global climate databases for environmental and ecological studies.\n\n-   The **YEARLPP** attribute represents annual precipitation ranges in millimeters.\n-   The **YPPDESC** attribute provides a qualitative description of the precipitation range (e.g., Extremely Low, High) along with information on associated landscapes.\n-   The **top** attribute defines the upper limit of each precipitation range in millimeters, useful for calculations and comparative analysis.\n\n### **Data Sources:**\n\nThe BIO12 variable can be downloaded from the official **WorldClim** website:\\\n* <https://www.worldclim.org/data/bioclim.html>\\\n* <https://www.worldclim.org/data/worldclim21.html>\n\nThe specific dataset used: **wc2.1_30s_prec.zip**\n\nFor an example describing the data and its application:\\\n* <https://hafezahmad.medium.com/world-bioclimatic-data-downloading-analysis-and-visualization-643c5c04f667>",
