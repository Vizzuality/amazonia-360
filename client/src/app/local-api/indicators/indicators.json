    "description_pt": "**Biodiversity Richness Classes Layer in the Amazon**  \n\nThis polygon layer represents species richness classes across the Amazon. Biodiversity, or species richness, is not evenly distributed in the Amazon but reflects habitat diversity throughout the region. Mapping biological richness is essential for analyzing habitat distribution and overlap, identifying key conservation areas, and prioritizing sustainable management actions.  \n\nThis layer is an adaptation by AmazoniaForever360+ based on the *IUCN_RL_2022_1_Species_Ranges* dataset. This extensive dataset represents the global geographic distribution of thousands of species assessed by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the global standard for biodiversity conservation status. It includes mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, plants, and other taxonomic groups, providing a comprehensive overview of global biodiversity. Each geographic range is defined by detailed polygons representing areas where species are native, resident, migratory, or introduced. These data also include each species' conservation status based on IUCN categories, which is crucial for identifying conservation priorities, monitoring biodiversity trends, and assessing human activity impacts on threatened species.  \n\n**Layer Creation Process**  \nTo develop this layer, the original dataset was clipped to the Amazon region. Species counts were aggregated into an H3 level 6 grid (approximately 30 km² cells). Sampling was conducted using centroids separated by 7 km, and species richness ranges were interpolated. The resulting fields include:  \n- **SPRange**: Defines the numerical range of species richness in each polygon (e.g., '<250 species', '800–1,000 species'), offering a quantitative biodiversity framework.  \n- **SPClass1**: Describes the ecological and environmental characteristics associated with each richness range, detailing the ecosystem context and importance (e.g., 'extremely low species richness' or 'very high species richness').  \n\n**Key Applications**  \nThis layer is a valuable tool for scientists, planners, and environmental managers, supporting sustainable development and biodiversity conservation efforts. It helps prioritize conservation actions, monitor trends, and analyze the impact of human activities on ecosystems.  \n\n**Data Access**  \n- Available to registered users on IBAT: https://www.ibat-alliance.org/  \n- Publicly accessible spatial data from the IUCN Red List:  \n  https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/spatial-data-download?utm_source=chatgpt.com  \n\n**Methodology and Mapping Standards**  \nFor detailed mapping standards and criteria, refer to *Mapping_Standards_Version_1.20_Jan2024.pdf*:  \nhttps://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/mappingstandards  ",

Este indicador permite identificar regiones con déficit energético, facilitando la planificación de políticas para expandir la infraestructura eléctrica en zonas vulnerables. El indicador de Acceso a la Electricidad mide la proporción de la población con acceso a electricidad en una determinada área geográfica y es un componente clave del Objetivo de Desarrollo Sostenible 7 (ODS 7), que busca garantizar el acceso universal a energía asequible, confiable, sostenible y moderna. Se basa en la combinación de datos satelitales y modelos de población. En primer lugar, se utilizan los datos de WorldPop, un modelo global de distribución de población, para estimar cuántas personas habitan en cada unidad geográfica. Luego, esta información se cruza con los datos de VIIRS Nighttime  Lights  Version 2 (VNL V2), un conjunto de imágenes satelitales que mapea la intensidad de la iluminación nocturna. Se asume que las áreas iluminadas tienen acceso a electricidad y que la población ubicada dentro de estos polígonos cuenta con suministro eléctrico. \n\nCompilación por AmazoniaForever360+ a partir de los datos globales originales.

The original database has been significantly simplified, retaining the following fields:\n\n-   **(disorder_t):** Describes the type of disorder with several broad categories:\n\n    -   **'Demonstrations'** -- Organized protests, which may be peaceful or violent. These typically serve as expressions of social or political demands.\n    -   **'Political violence'** -- Acts of violence with political motivations.\n    -   **'Political violence; Demonstrations'** -- Refers to situations where peaceful demonstrations become violent due to external actors or escalating tensions.\n    -   **'Strategic developments'** -- Large-scale strategic actions or developments related to policy changes, external interventions, or significant transformations in a region's social or political structure.\n-   **(event_type):** Event type, such as 'Protests' or 'Riots.'\n\n-   **(sub_event):** Defines the exact nature of the event, describing whether the protest was peaceful or violent.\n\nACLED is an open-access data project, meaning most of its data is freely available.

This information is crucial for assessing the risks and challenges faced by sustainable development projects. The presence of armed conflicts, protests, or attacks on communities can impact the feasibility of initiatives in sectors such as environmental conservation, infrastructure, food security, and access to basic services.

They highlight governance challenges that impact sustainable development. High homicide rates indicate insecurity, making it difficult to implement social, economic, and infrastructure initiatives, as affected communities tend to be more isolated and face greater limitations in accessing basic services. Violence can also erode trust in local institutions, weakening their ability to provide services and enforce effective policies, creating a vicious cycle of distrust and conflict. Additionally, high homicide rates and violence can discourage investment, as businesses and investors are often reluctant to operate in environments where security and social stability are compromised.

It uses high-resolution pixels (100 meters per pixel), with population values derived from multiple sources, including national censuses, household surveys, and spatial distribution models. Additionally, satellite data from the **Sentinel-1** and **Sentinel-2** missions of the **Copernicus** program enhance the identification of built structures and urban or rural areas.\n\nThis data was leveraged to generate a layer of settlements exceeding one square kilometer, with estimated **2025 population figures** assigned to each area.
