AmazoniaForever 360+ is a platform developed to provide critical geospatial and territorial data, supporting conservation and sustainable efforts in the Amazon region. Designed for non-expert users, it equips government officials, NGOs, local communities, and professionals working in environmental planning and development with tools to monitor environmental changes and implement strategic actions.

# Platform Overview
AmazoniaForever 360+ is designed to serve spatial and statistical data through a user-friendly interface that supports:
- Exploring pre-processed geospatial indicators structured over an H3 hexagonal grid.
- Interacting with dynamic maps using tiled vector or raster layers.
- Querying aggregated data by area or administrative boundary through zonal statistics.
- Filtering geographies based on custom polygons or map extent.
- Generating reports with AI-assisted summaries. 
The platform uses ArcGIS Online to host and serve most raster and vector data, including zonal statistics, administrative boundaries, and thematic layers. A custom Python microservice is used for serving the H3 grid data in Apache Arrow format.

# Architecture

AmazoniaForever 360+ uses a hybrid architecture that combines ArcGIS Online services with a custom backend for performance-sensitive data processing.

## Components

- [Front-end](client/README.md): `client/`. React frontend using Mapbox GL JS and ArcGIS SDK
- [Backend API](api/README.md): `api/`. Python FastAPI service for h3 data server and AI  summary generation
- [Infrastructure](infrastructure/README.md): `infrastructure/`. Infrastructure management with Terraform
- [Science and prototypes](science/README.md): `science/`. Python prototypes and data management sketches.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, Next.js,  ArcGIS SDK
- Backend: python FastpAPI
- Geospatial Services: 
- Infrastructure: Terraform

# Running the Platform Locally

To set up AmazoniaForever 360+ on your local machine use

```
docker compose up â€“build
```

from the root directory to spin all the services (client and api). Now visiting localhost:3000 in any browser should show the landing page.
