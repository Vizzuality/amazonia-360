AmazoniaForever 360+ is a platform developed to provide critical geospatial and territorial data, supporting conservation and sustainable efforts in the Amazon region. Designed for non-expert users, it equips government officials, NGOs, local communities, and professionals working in environmental planning and development with tools to monitor environmental changes and implement strategic actions.

# Platform Overview <a name="overview"></a>
AmazoniaForever 360+ is designed to serve spatial and statistical data through a user-friendly interface that supports:
- Exploring pre-processed geospatial indicators structured over an H3-based hexagonal grid. This allows quick access to
    large number of datasets and the ability to easily cross-filter any of them.
- An in-depth report for all available data sources.
- Querying aggregated data by area or administrative boundary through zonal statistics.
- Filtering geographies based on custom polygons or map extent.
- Generating reports with AI-assisted summaries.
-
The platform uses ArcGIS Online to host and serve most raster and vector data, including zonal statistics, administrative boundaries,
and thematic layers. The h3 data server and AI summary reports are build in an independent python application.

# Architecture <a name="arch"></a>

AmazoniaForever 360+ uses a hybrid architecture that combines ArcGIS Online services with a custom backend for performance-sensitive data processing.

## Components <a name="components"></a>

- [Front-end](client/README.md): `client/`. React frontend using Mapbox GL JS and ArcGIS SDK
- [Backend API](api/README.md): `api/`. Python FastAPI service for h3 data server and AI  summary generation
- [Infrastructure](infrastructure/README.md): `infrastructure/`. Infrastructure management with Terraform
- [Science and prototypes](science/README.md): `science/`. Python prototypes and data management sketches.

## Tech Stack <a name="stack"></a>

- Frontend: React, Next.js, ArcGIS SDK
- Backend: python FastAPI
- Infrastructure: Terraform

# Running it locally <a name="run"></a>

To set up AmazoniaForever 360+ on your local machine first create a `.env` file from the template `.env.default`
at the root of the project and fill in the needed environment variables.

Then run

```
docker compose up â€“build
```

from the root directory to spin all the services (client and api).
Now visiting localhost:3000 in any browser should show the landing page.

Note that some environment variables are secret tokens needed to authorize the use of some parts of the API like
ArcGIS services which may be crucial for some of the application features.
